# Nicehash api

### Examples

- [javascript](https://github.com/nicehash/rest-clients-demo/blob/master/javascript/hashpower.js)

### TEST environment

Generate Api key and Secret for test platform on:

https://test.nicehash.com (User / Settings / API Keys)
Organization ID is displayed just above "+ Create new API key" button.

Use https://api-test.nicehash.com for API domain.

The entire platform runs on testnet. This means that you donâ€™t have to use your own funds to test the platform. This is the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the new system, place hash-power orders and try trading without spending any real money.

### PRODUCTION environment

To use production just generate key the same way on https://www.nicehash.com and use https://api2.nicehash.com for API domain.

### API docs
